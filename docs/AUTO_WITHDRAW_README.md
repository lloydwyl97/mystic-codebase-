## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Docker Desktop Not Running
```powershell
# Start Docker Desktop manually
# Or check if it's running
docker version
```

#### API Key Errors
1. **Verify API keys** in `backend/.env`
2. **Check permissions** - ensure withdrawal is enabled
3. **Test API access** manually first
4. **Check IP restrictions** if enabled

#### Balance Not Updating
1. **Check exchange API** status
2. **Verify network connectivity**
3. **Check rate limits** - increase `CHECK_INTERVAL`
4. **Review logs** for specific errors

#### Withdrawal Failures
1. **Verify cold wallet address** is correct
2. **Check network selection** (ETH, BSC, etc.)
3. **Ensure sufficient balance** for fees
4. **Review exchange withdrawal limits**

### Performance Optimization

#### For High-Frequency Monitoring
```env
CHECK_INTERVAL=30  # Check every 30 seconds
```
